# Number Complement

给定一个正整数，输出其补数。补数规则是翻转二进制表示的比特位。

提示：

1. 给定的整数保证为32位有符号整数


2. 可以假设整数的二进制表示中没有前导零位

>Example 1:

>Input: 5

>Output: 2

>Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

>Input: 1

>Output: 0

>Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
