## Problem

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:

s = "abcd"

t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

## Pre analysis

It is same as finding extra number in two arrays. will substract summation of one with other.

## Another Solution

1.  Same Approach using `^`

        var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
            let result = 0;
            for(let i=0;i<t.length;i++) {
                result = result ^ t.charCodeAt(i);
                if(i<=s.length-1) {
                    result = result ^ s.charCodeAt(i);
                }
            }

            return String.fromCharCode(result);
        };

2.  Sorting and finding O(N2)

        var findTheDifference = function(s, t) {
            s = s.split('').sort();
            t = t.split('').sort();

            for(let i = 0; i < t.length; i++) {
                if(s[i] !== t[i]) {
                    return t[i]
                }
            }
        };
