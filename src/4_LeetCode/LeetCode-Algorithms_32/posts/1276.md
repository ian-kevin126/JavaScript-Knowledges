# 1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients

## 题目

Given two integers `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The ingredients of different burgers are as follows:

- Jumbo Burger: 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
- Small Burger: 2 Tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.

Return `[total_jumbo, total_small]` so that the number of remaining `tomatoSlices` equal to 0 and the number of remaining `cheeseSlices` equal to 0. If it is not possible to make the remaining `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` equal to 0 return `[]`.

Example 1:

```shell
Input: tomatoSlices = 16, cheeseSlices = 7
Output: [1,6]
Explantion: To make one jumbo burger and 6 small burgers we need 4*1 + 2*6 = 16 tomato and 1 + 6 = 7 cheese. There will be no remaining ingredients.
```

Example 2:

```shell
Input: tomatoSlices = 17, cheeseSlices = 4
Output: []
Explantion: There will be no way to use all ingredients to make small and jumbo burgers.
```

Example 3:

```shell
Input: tomatoSlices = 4, cheeseSlices = 17
Output: []
Explantion: Making 1 jumbo burger there will be 16 cheese remaining and making 2 small burgers there will be 15 cheese remaining.
```

Example 4:

```shell
Input: tomatoSlices = 0, cheeseSlices = 0
Output: [0,0]
```

Example 5:

```shell
Input: tomatoSlices = 2, cheeseSlices = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

```shell
0 <= tomatoSlices <= 10^7
0 <= cheeseSlices <= 10^7
```

## 思路

又是一道题目描述很长，但其实内容很简单的问题。
