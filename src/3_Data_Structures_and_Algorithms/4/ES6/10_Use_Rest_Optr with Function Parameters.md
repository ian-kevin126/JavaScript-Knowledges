#### Syntactically, it looks exactly the same as spread operator. But itâ€™s function is the exact opposite of the spread Operator. If Spread operator expands individual items, then rest operator collects a bunch of items and puts them into arrays and objects.

In order to help us create more flexible functions, ES6 introduces the rest operator for function parameters. With the rest operator, you can create functions that take a variable number of arguments. These arguments are stored in an array that can be accessed later from inside the function.

Check out this code:
```js
function howMany(...args) {
  return "You have passed " + args.length + " arguments.";
}
console.log(howMany(0, 1, 2)); // You have passed 3 arguments
console.log(howMany("string", null, [1, 2, 3], { })); // You have passed 4 arguments.
```
The rest operator eliminates the need to check the `args` array and allows us to apply `map(), filter() and reduce()` on the parameters array.


Modify the function `sum` so that it uses the rest operator and it works in the same way with any number of parameters.

```js
const sum = (function() { // < IIFE, we are not calling this
  "use strict";
  return function sum(...args) { // we are calling this closure
    //const args = [ x, y, z ];
    return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
  };
})();
console.log(sum(1, 2, 3, 4)); // 6
```
