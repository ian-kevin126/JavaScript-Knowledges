BEM is the third methodology we are going to look at, and is on the other side of the spectrum from SMACSS. BEM is simply a class naming convention. Instead of dictating the structure of your CSS, it only suggests that every element is labeled with a class that describes the following:

Block
The name of the parent component
Element
The name of the element inside of the block
Modifier
Any modifier associated with the block or element
