<h1>Feature Detect Support for Payment Request API</h1>

<div id="intro">
    <p>
        This example shows how a legacy checkout form can be replaced by a Payment Request
        - only for browsers that support it - using:
        <code>if (window.PaymentRequest) { ... }</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the purposes of the demo, imagine you have chosen an item and now you need to
        check out. Please note that no payments will be taken, this is just a front-end
        demo. If you would like to try entering card details, you can use dummy data,
        for example the card number <code>4111 1111 1111 1111</code>.
    </p>

    <button id="checkout-button">Checkout</button>
</div>

<div id="success">
    <p>
        Payment Request success. Demo complete. No payment has been taken.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="legacy">
    <p>
        The Payment Request API is unsupported or was cancelled or failed,
        so here we can proceed with our legacy web form (not implemented for this demo).
