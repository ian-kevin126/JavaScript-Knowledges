## Complexity

- delete: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
- insert: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
- contains: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case
- depthFirstLog: Linear — O(n), or O(log n) in average case

## Exercises

- Design an algorithm to find a path from one node in a binary tree to another.

- Given a binary tree, check whether it’s a binary search tree or not.

- Find the minimum depth of binary search tree

- Given a binary search tree and a value k, please find a node in the binary search tree whose value is closest to k.
