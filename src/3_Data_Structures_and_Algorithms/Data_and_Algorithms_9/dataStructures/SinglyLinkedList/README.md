# ⚗️ SinglyLinkedList

## Definition

> A Singly Linked List is a linear collection of data elements, called nodes pointing to the next node by means of pointer. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. From Wikipedia

Linked Lists are among the simplest and most common data structures because it allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
