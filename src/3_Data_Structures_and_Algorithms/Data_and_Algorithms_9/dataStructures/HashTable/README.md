# ⚗️ Hash Table Data Structure

## Definition

> A Hash Table (Hash Map) is a data structure used to implement an associative array, a structure that can map keys to values. A Hash Table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. From Wikipedia

Hash Tables are considered the more efficient data structure for lookup and for this reason, they are widely used.
