# Create a Events Library!

## Directions

Create an 'eventing' library out of the Events class. See `jquery-example.html` for demo. The Events class should have these methods below:

**on**: Register an event handler
**trigger**: Trigger all callbacks associated with a given eventName
**off**: Remove all event handlers associated with the given eventName
